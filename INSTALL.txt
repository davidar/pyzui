PyZUI INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===============================
PyZUI was developed under Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid Ibex. It has also been tested on
Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope, Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala, and Windows XP.

DEPENDENCIES
============
PyZUI depends on the following Python packages:
- PyQt4
- Python Imaging Library (PIL)

The following non-Python packages are also required by certain features of the
application:
- ImageMagick (highly recommended, but strictly optional if you do not intend
  using images of any format other than PPM; the absence of ImageMagick may
  also break other parts of the application as well)
- pdftoppm from Poppler or Xpdf (optional if you do not intend viewing PDFs);
  Note that PyZUI has been developed using the pdftoppm binary provided by
  Poppler
- jrMandel (optional if you do not intend viewing the Mandelbrot set dynamic
  media)

UBUNTU/DEBIAN SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
===================================
PyQt4, PIL and ImageMagick can be installed in Debian-based distributions by:
  apt-get install python-qt4 python-imaging imagemagick

pdftoppm can be installed by either:
  apt-get install poppler-utils
or:
  apt-get install xpdf-reader

jrMandel can be downloaded from <http://freshmeat.net/projects/jrmandel/>,
and installed with the standard:
  ./configure && make && make install

WINDOWS SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
=============================
PyQt4, PIL and ImageMagick can be installed in Windows by downloading and
running the installers available from their respective websites:
- http://riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
- http://pythonware.com/products/pil/
- http://imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows

Due to a conflict between the the 'convert.exe' provided by ImageMagick and
that provided by Windows NT/2000/XP (see
<http://savage.net.au/ImageMagick/html/install-convert.html>), you will need to
rename the 'convert.exe' provided by ImageMagick (in
C:\Program Files\ImageMagick-XXXXXXXXX\) to 'imconvert.exe'.

pdftoppm can be installed by downloading the Win32 binary zip archive from
<http://foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html>, extracting it, and copying
'pdftoppm.exe' to somewhere in your PATH (such as C:\WINDOWS\system32\).

I haven't tried using jrMandel on Windows as it would need to be compiled from
source with something like MSVC, and I'm not even sure it is supported on
Windows.

RUNNING PyZUI
=============
PyZUI can be run by executing the script 'main.py'. It is not necessary to run
this from the command-line (unless you want to view the logging), and it can be
run from any directory (the script will set the set the working directory
appropriately by itself).

In Windows just double-click on 'main.py'. If you don't want the logging window
to be shown, rename it to 'main.pyw' first.
