PyZUI INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===============================
PyZUI was developed under Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid Ibex. It has also been tested on
Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope.

DEPENDENCIES
============
PyZUI depends on the following Python packages:
- PyQt4
- Python Imaging Library (PIL)

These can be installed in Debian-based distributions by:
  apt-get install python-qt4 python-imaging

The following non-Python packages are also required by certain features of the
application:
- ImageMagick (highly recommended, but strictly optional if you do not intend
  using images of any format other than PPM)
- pdftoppm from Poppler or Xpdf (optional if you do not intend viewing PDFs);
  Note that PyZUI has been developed using the pdftoppm binary provided by
  Poppler
- jrMandel (optional if you do not intend viewing the Mandelbrot set dynamic
  media)

ImageMagick can be installed in Debian-based distributions by:
  apt-get install imagemagick

pdftoppm can be installed in Debian-based distributions by either:
  apt-get install poppler-utils
or:
  apt-get install xpdf-reader

jrMandel can be downloaded from <http://freshmeat.net/projects/jrmandel/>,
and installed with the standard:
  ./configure && make && make install

RUNNING PyZUI
=============
PyZUI can be run by executing the script 'main.py'. It is not necessary to run
this from the command-line (unless you want to view the logging), and it can be
run from any directory (the script will set the set the working directory
appropriately by itself).
